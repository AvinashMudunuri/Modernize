                    	With ModernizeNow, companies can now take advantage of these same proven tools and approaches through an easy-to-use, 
                        low-cost, lighting fast, web-based service.  While previously companies may have felt migration only made 
                        sense for large-scale, critical applications, ModernizeNow makes it simple and cost effective to migrate 
                        both small and medium-sized PowerBuilder applications to web-based Java or .NET platforms.

                    <li><br />
                    	Simply sign up for an account, upload your selected code, and indicate your preference for either .NET or Java.  
                        Within 48 hours, we'll send you a secure link where you can view and test your migrated application at no cost or 
                        obligation.  If you are fully satisfied with the results, you can decide to purchase the migrated code.

                    	ModernizeNow is ideal for small to medium-sized applications requiring 1:1 migration.  If you are looking to make 
                        substantial enhancements to the application during the modernization process or if you would like to customize the 
                        architecture component mapping, contact SoftSol and one of our Solutions Architects will work with you to design a 
                        solution tailored to your unique requirements.

            	<strong>Does your solution also migrate PFC code? </strong>
                <ul style="line-height:20px">
                	<li><br />
                    	Yes.  ModernizeNow migrates PFC functionality. Unlike PowerBuilder code migration, PFC code 
                        will not be translated as-is for reasons of maintainability and platform compatibility. Instead 
                        equivalent functionality is provided in the migrated application using a mix of migrated code, 
                        third party components, reusable libraries developed by SoftSol.
